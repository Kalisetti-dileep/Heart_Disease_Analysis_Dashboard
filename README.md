I recently worked on a Heart Disease Analysis Dashboard in Power BI, utilizing DAX for advanced calculations and insights.

This project focuses on exploring patient data to uncover survival patterns, average age of survival, and the impact of health conditions like high blood pressure, diabetes, anemia, and smoking across various age groups.

üîç Key Highlights:
Survival Rate: 67.89%
Average Age of Survival: 58.76 years
Interactive visuals showing trends by Age Group
DAX-powered calculations for Survival Rate, Death Count, and Medical Condition Impact
Clear insights into how lifestyle and medical conditions influence heart disease outcomes

üìå Skills Used:
Power BI
DAX (Data Analysis Expressions)
Data Cleaning & Transformation
Data Visualization & Storytelling
